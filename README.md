A Zenphoto theme

About
--------------

Install/upload the "zpbase" folder into the "themes" folder of your Zenphoto installation. Activate theme and set options in the backend administration of Zenphoto.

Zenphoto is a standalone CMS for multimedia focused websites. Our focus lies on being easy to use and having all the features there when you need them (but out of the way if you do not.)

Zenphoto features support for images, video and audio formats, and the Zenpage CMS plugin provides a fully integrated news section (blog) and custom pages to run entire websites.

This makes Zenphoto the ideal CMS for personal websites of illustrators, artists, designers, photographers, film makers and musicians.

zpBase is a theme for Zenphoto with minimal style by design and ease of customization. Options to start at a base of light or dark contrast. Fully responsive from mobile to desktop, no need for separate themes, features for phones, tablets, etc - all built in. Fully fluid with ability to set your own max-width or go full 100% width. Multiple layouts with more to come for homepage, albums, search, and news.  Can choose default layout and with multiple layout plugin enabled can choose different layouts per album. Current layouts include Default Grid, Masonry, Smooth DIV Scroll (SDS), and Galleria. Use of Infinite Scroll with mutiple options - manually load more, automatic, or manual first time - then automatic (sweet!). Custom built in Slideshow (Galleria), and image popup (Magnific).  Both fullscreen and fully responsive. Most Galleria settings configurable in theme options. Built in lightweight social sharing tools, as well as ability to link to your own Facebook/G+/Twitter pages via settings. Unique search/archive page. Full Zenpage support, with Acrylian's Featured Image plugin support, and new GalleryArticles plugin support. Configure on/off elements such as dates, image download links, search/archive, background and logo images, Built in optional Disqus commenting (or use core commenting, or none!) Set custom CSS in settings (database), so they are not lost with theme upgrades. Set relative base font size in settings. Optionally select different Google fonts to use for headers and body text. Integrated Google Analytics (non-admin only), just enter your key in the theme options.

And more to come!
